RandomClue

How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?
-- A solution in fewer than 20 guesses was rare for any theory tested. This is because if the numbers are all 1, all 
the highest number or a random number, it is equally likely to guess it correctly randomly.

What is good or bad about this strategy?
--The good thing about this strategy is that the numbers don't affect the probability of being correct in less than 20 
guesses. The bad thing is that it's unlikely to guess correctly in fewer than 20 tries.


Detective Jill -- My solution
How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?
-- My solution always guesses correctly in 20 guesses or less. This doesn't change based on the theory but for theory 2,
 it will never be less than 20 guesses. This is because I start from 1 and increment each time the guess is said to be 
 incorrect.
 
What is good or bad about this strategy?
The good thing about this strategy is that it is always correct in 20 guesses or less. The bad thing about this strategy
is that higher theories (6, 10 , 6) will always require more guesses.
